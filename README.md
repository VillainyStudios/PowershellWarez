Want to add your name to the list?  Working on a nifty tool?  Email MrSchism to sling one of your ideas.

Tools
-----
1. Task Manager Toggler - A tool to enable/disable task manager while not in the FSoT labs
2. Clipboard Logger - A tool for logging clipboard data; great for collecting references and quotes without worry.
3. File Scraper - A tool used to search for and return data in documents

More on the way (as we find need and develop).  These 'tools' may be anything of merit, given a novel enough approach.  Even a decent, unique game (ideally anything with netcode).

Languages
---------

Ideally, any language would work, but the best tools work out-of-the-box; that being said, currently we're looking at Java and PowerShell.  If your tool is compiled, that works also.  We are also happy to support Linux and Mac development, should you have the personal desire to do so.

All projects must be open source and wholly owned by you or your project team.
